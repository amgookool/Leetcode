# Move Zeroes

## Question

Given an integer array ```nums```, move all ```0```'s to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.

**Note** that you must do this in-place without making a copy of the array.

## Contrains

- ```1 <= nums.length <= 10^4```
- ```-2^31 <= nums[i] <= 2^31 - 1```

### Example 1

```markdown

INPUT: nums = [0,1,0,3,12]

OUTPUT: [1,3,12,0,0]
```

### Example 2

```markdown

INPUT: nums = [0]

OUTPUT: [0]
```
