# Single Number

## Question

Given a non-empty array of integers ```nums```, every element appears _twice_ except for one. Find that single one.

You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space.

## Contrains

- ```1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 10^4```
- ```-3 * 10^4 <= nums[i] <= 10^4```
- Each element in the array appears twice except for one element which appears only once.

### Example 1

```markdown

INPUT: nums = [2,2,1]

OUTPUT: 1
```

### Example 2

```markdown

INPUT: nums = [4,1,2,1,2]

OUTPUT: 4
```

### Example 3

```markdown

INPUT: nums = [1]

OUTPUT: 1
```
