# Intersection of Two Arrays II

## Question

Given two integer arrays ```nums1``` and ```nums2```, return _an array of their intersection_.

Each element in the result must appear as many times as it shows in both arrays and you may return the result in **any order**.

## Contrains

- ```1 <= nums1.length, nums2.length <= 1000```
- ```0 <= nums1[i], nums2[i] <= 1000```

### Example 1

```markdown

INPUT: nums1 = [1,2,2,1], nums2 = [2,2]

OUTPUT: [2,2]
```

### Example 2

```markdown

INPUT: nums1 = [4,9,5], nums2 = [9,4,9,8,4]

OUTPUT: [4,9]

EXPLANATION:
[9,4] is also accepted.
```
