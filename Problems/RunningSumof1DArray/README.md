# Running Sum of 1D Array

## Question

Given an array **nums**. We ddefine a running sum of an array as **runningSum[i] = sum(nums[0]...nums[i])**.

Return the running sum of nums.

### Example 1

```text
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]

Output: [1,3,6,10]

Explanation: Running sum is obtained as follows:

[1, 1+2, 1+2+3, 1+2+3+4]
```

### Example 2

```text
Input: nums = [1,1,1,1,1]

Output: [1,2,3,4,5]

Explanation: Running sum is obtained as follows:

[1, 1+1, 1+1+1, 1+1+1+1, 1+1+1+1+1]
```

### Example 3

```text
Input: nums = [3,1,2,10,1]

Output: [3,4,6,16, 17]
```
